# stochastic-modeling

Implementing Euler's method to Stochastic Differential Equations. Applying derivations from Kramers Moyal Formula as presented by Dai et al.

In short, given simulated data in first graph, approximate the diffusion and drift functions in the second graph. The third graph highlights an approximation of the drift functions.
